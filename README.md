# üçÑ Smart Mushroom House Monitoring System

## Overview
IoT-based smart monitoring system for mushroom cultivation.  
Monitors environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, CO2, and water pH.  
Data is displayed on a 20x4 LCD and uploaded in real-time to Firebase Realtime Database.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, CO2, and pH
- Data displayed on LCD 20x4
- Automatic data upload to Firebase
- Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring
- Alerts via Serial Monitor if sensor fails

## Hardware
- ESP32
- DHT22 (temperature & humidity)
- MQ135 (CO2 sensor)
- Analog pH sensor
- LCD 20x4 I2C

## Software
- Arduino IDE (C++)
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Wi-Fi network connection
